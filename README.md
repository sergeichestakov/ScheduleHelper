## How it works

ScheduleHelper simplifies building your schedule by finding potential conflicts ahead of time and color coding classes in search results based on whether or not they fit in your schedule.

It also conveniently displays the ratings of each professor with a direct link to their rate my professor page.

### Color Coding
* **Blue** - Currently in your schedule
* **Red** - Conflicts with one of your classes
* **Yellow** - Does not conflict, but is full
* **Green** - Fits in your schedule

### Data from Rate My Professor
Rate my professor is a website seemingly *every* student has pulled up when deciding on their schedule for the next quarter.
With Schedule Helper, you no longer need to keep switching back and forth between tabs and searching up the professor of each class you consider,
their ratings are right there next to their name. Better yet, their name now links directly to their rate my professor page!

### Conflict information
In addition to marking conflicting classes as red, Schedule Helper tells you which one of your selected classes they conflict with.
Simply hover over the name of the class to see!

## How to install


#### Chrome
Visit https://getschedulehelper.com/ or download directly from this [link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/uc-davis-schedule-helper/eaiohlimbkhifknljidephnpadioaiab?hl=en-US&gl=US "Chrome Web Store").

#### Firefox
Unfortunately, I was unable to host the extension on the Firefox add-ons store, so if you wish to use it for Firefox you will have to sideload it.
Simply download the .xpi file in the assets directory and follow these [instructions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Alternative_distribution_options/Sideloading_add-ons#Using_Install_Add-on_From_File).
